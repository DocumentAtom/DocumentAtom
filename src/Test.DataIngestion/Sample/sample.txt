# DocumentAtom Data Ingestion Test

This is a sample document for testing the DocumentAtom.DataIngestion library.

## Introduction

DocumentAtom provides a powerful way to parse documents and break them into constituent atoms for AI, machine learning, and analytics applications.

The DataIngestion module extends DocumentAtom with capabilities for:
- Reading documents of various formats
- Converting atoms to ingestion elements
- Chunking content for embedding and vector storage
- Preserving document hierarchy and metadata

## Features

### Multi-Format Support

The library supports many document formats including:
- PDF documents
- Microsoft Word (DOCX)
- Microsoft Excel (XLSX)
- Microsoft PowerPoint (PPTX)
- HTML and Markdown
- JSON and XML
- Plain text and RTF
- Images with OCR

### Intelligent Chunking

Content is chunked intelligently to preserve:
1. Paragraph boundaries
2. Header context
3. Semantic relationships
4. Document structure

### Metadata Preservation

All metadata from the original atoms is preserved and mapped to the ingestion format, enabling rich filtering and retrieval in vector databases.

## Conclusion

This sample demonstrates the basic structure that DocumentAtom.DataIngestion handles when processing documents for RAG and AI applications.
